# change_values
Simple change of values 
This work was created for reading vibration files  
with values in their columns. It then generates a    
final file with one column from each file, where     
each column contains information about the vibration 
mode. Add in this, our new code change all values in                                           
the columns of the files that are smaller than 0.2                                                
and 0.6 to an negative value. The final files are
Tper_final_3.csv to values of 0.2 and Tperc_final_4.csv to values 0.6
